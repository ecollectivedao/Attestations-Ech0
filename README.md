# AttestationStation Data Duplicator

The AttesationStation Data Duplicator (`atstdd`) is a framework for duplicating data from external sources into the [AttestationStation](https://community.optimism.io/docs/identity/build/) smart contracts on OP Mainnet and OP Goerli.
`atstdd` is designed to be verifiable so that external data sources can be imported into the AttestationStation without the need for trustless bridging mechanisms.
